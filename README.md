## Under the Hood

### Custom Fish Scripts

Leveraging the best of oh-my-zsh, I've crafted custom Fish scripts, including git and eza abbreviations, enriching your shell without the need for plugins.

### Chezmoi: The Backbone

At the heart of our dotfile management is Chezmoi, a robust tool offering [templating features](https://www.chezmoi.io/user-guide/templating/) to dynamically adapt scripts across various systems, alongside the capability to preview and verify scripts before execution.
