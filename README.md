- Dotfile management with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
- `update` script for updating dotfiles, system packages, etc.
- Will detect your OS and install the corresponding packages (only works for Arch/Manjaro for now).
- Guided script that will require user input before doing anything.
- Better [ls](https://the.exa.website/) command.
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with the awesome [configuration by gpakosz](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).

## Installation

> NOTE: Only works for Ubuntu and Arch based distros. May change in the future.

Dotfiles are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:


```sh
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/mmena1/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

## Updating

Use this single command to get the latest updates:

```
update
```

This command will update dotfiles and system packages.

## Under the hood

### Custom Fish scripts

- I included custom fish scripts by adapting from oh-my-zsh, like git and exa abbreviations.
- Fish doesn't need plugins as zsh does. Just some personal touches :sunglasses:

### Dotbot

It uses [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) as a github submodule to manage dotfiles.
What it basically does is to symlink the files from `home` and `config` directories
into your `~` home folder and then run the bootstrap scripts to setup the system apps I personally use.
