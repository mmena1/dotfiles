# Martin Mena‚Äôs dotfiles

This is my personal dotfiles configuration.

![shell_demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4404853/211460867-4cab5adb-c979-4a47-86a5-e6bb11f9f0dc.gif)

Here are some notes:

- My weapon of choice is Arch/Manjaro.
  - May change in the future, but now I'm happy with Arch based distros.
- Fish and Zsh configurations.
  - I used to work with Zsh / ["Oh My ZSH!"](http://ohmyz.sh/), but I'm currently using Fish with custom configurations.
  - I still have my old zsh configuration as a backup in case I stumble upon incompatible scripts (happened once to me).
- [üöÄ‚≠êÔ∏è Starship](https://starship.rs/) as a prompt.
- [nyan cat](./bin/nyan).

- Dotfile management with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).
- `update` script for updating dotfiles, system packages, etc.
- Will detect your OS and install the corresponding packages (only works for Arch/Manjaro for now).
- Guided script that will require user input before doing anything.
- Better [ls](https://the.exa.website/) command.

## Zsh features
- ["Oh My ZSH!"](http://ohmyz.sh/)
- üêü [Fish](https://fishshell.com/)-like autosuggestions.
- Syntax highlighting of commands while they are typed.
- Browser-like substring search for history.
- [antigen](https://github.com/zsh-users/antigen) for dependency management.
- Useful [aliases](./lib/aliases.zsh).
- Git [aliases](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/tree/master/plugins/git).
- [Tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) with the awesome [configuration by gpakosz](https://github.com/gpakosz/.tmux).

## Fish features
![shell_demo2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4404853/211461280-e4396733-53dd-46da-a915-ef8bffd8afa1.gif)

- Same as Zsh, without the baggage of oh-my-zsh. No 3rd-party plugins, just my custom scripts that I adapted from oh-my-zsh.
- No tmux :(
    - I couldn't properly configure the shell to auto start/close tmux and
    having to manually type `tmux` and `exit` every time I open a new terminal is a deal breaker for me.
    - [Kitty](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/) to the rescue :D. It offers most of the tmux features plus some other cool stuff.

Missing feature? üç¥ Fork this repo and make it better!

## Installation

Dotfiles are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:


```sh
# Clone dotfiles repo
git clone https://github.com/mmena1/dotfiles.git $HOME/.dotfiles

# Go to the dotfiles directory
cd $HOME/.dotfiles

# Install dotfiles
./install
```

## TODOs / Planned features

- [ ] Choice between Zsh and Fish (or both) instead of forcing both of them during installation
- [ ] Option for unattended script that installs the default config without prompting the user.
- [ ] Support for Ubuntu/Debian
- [ ] Migrate to [chezmoi](https://www.chezmoi.io/)
- [ ] (Maybe) Support for MacOS - I'm not a fan of Macbooks, but sometimes I'm forced to work with them.
  If that happens in the future, I may reconsider adding support for them.

## Updating

Use this single command to get the latest updates:

```
update
```

This command will update dotfiles, their dependencies (zsh) and system packages.

## Under the hood

### Oh-My-Zsh plugins

These OMZ plugins are included:

- [`git`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/git) - git aliases and functions.
- [`docker`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/docker) - provides docker completion as well as adding useful aliases.
- [`asdf`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/asdf) - Adds integration with [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/).
- [`ssh-agent`](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/tree/master/plugins/ssh-agent) - automatically starts ssh-agent to set up and load whichever credentials you want for ssh connections.

- More are listed in [`.zshrc`](./home/zshrc) (it's hard to keep the list updated).

## Tip jar

If you wanna buy me a coffee, it's always appreciated :)
